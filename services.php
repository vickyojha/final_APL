                            This process includes planning the structure and design of any building through architectural drawings, in which predictions of design specification calculations, graphics descriptions, sketches of structural plans, budget, time, guidelines and other documentation details are specified. Since architecture planning affects the security and performance of Building, it plays a premium role before constructing any building. It acts as an organized strategy for generating successful results.

It includes technical, embodiment and conceptual based specifications in which drawings are the outcome of conceptual designs. The main objective of conceptual designs in it is to write complete strategy on a piece of paper. It comprises of all in-depth requirement describing entire major components including, appropriate and overall layouts, outline specifications, dimensions, gridlines, fire strategy, project phases, architecture of different components, samples, component drawings, acoustic conditions, waste handling, standard layout identification, structural elevations, value management, etc.

                                Structure planning is an important stage of construction. This includes certain plans related to a structure of a building including size, front projections outline, materials, etc. Basically, Structural planning is a phase of Structural design which is done after collecting architectural plan of any building. This process consists of position and orientation of columns, beams positioning, Slabs Spanning, stairs overall layout and appropriate type of footing. We are having a team of experts having knowledge of all mandatory principles on effective sectional view planning such as location of the columns whether it is at corner or at intersection of walls of the building, preventing spans of beams. They are aware of preventing projection of columns, Beams positioning. They are aware of things that need to be avoided to lessen bending moments, preventing projection of columns, Beams positioning enlargement of spans, and projection of columns.

This drawing acts as a fundamental to proceed on further steps of development. This includes all necessary requirements such as furniture, dimensions, outlets, symbols, notation, equipment’s, wall colour , full view of a building including entire dimensions, sectional, elevation view of a wall, All manufacturer details of the paint, brand, colors etc. ,dimensional detail of the furniture, material details of furniture and door, space occupancy ,types of polishing. We have outstanding detail drawing software for our team for an efficient and accurate construction details. This detailed drawing helps them in setting up of communicating design which in turn helps in quality and workflow improvement.

                                Tendering is the process by which an organization invites certain suppliers by providing a formal written submission to carry out some particular tasks. The main objective of tender is to choose a contractor for a construction. Thus an environment is created to encourage contractors through tendering. One can acquire a fair and best price of construction undertaking, an accurate understanding of all rights and requirements for tenderation. We are utilizing overseas tendering to buy our services and to find suppliers and acquiring benefits such as maximizing competition and in accessing international contracts. We are providing a proper tender notice in local newspapers including proper title of projects, accurate location, and time and date so that contractors would respond to their particular requirements. </p>

The process includes climatic concerns, geological, topographical, ecological survey, structural analysis, measurements, valuation, flood risk analysis, Air quality monitoring, telecommunications, electrical infrastructure, and soil survey. This survey helps the engineer for risk identification. As it is an important aspect of construction, we hired a team of site survey professionals for conducting site surveys appropriate to a particular product, focusing on each parameter such as surrounding structures verification with topographical features, underground structures to safeguards workers, 3D scanning for planning, visualization, and collaboration. Our engineers will definitely help you to analyze your property accurately, land remodeling and its problematic area identification.

                                The mixture of binding and filler materials with coarse aggregate is known as concrete. It is too weak in resisting tensile stresses thus; reinforced concrete is used in the areas where there is a requirement of tensile stresses. Reinforced concrete consists of plates and steel bars which strengthen it. RCC contains numerous benefits such as great compressive strength, tensile stress, more durable, need less maintenance cost.
